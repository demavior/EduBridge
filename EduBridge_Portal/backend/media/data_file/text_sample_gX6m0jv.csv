6124231,"So these people needed religion to motivate them to help other human beings and stand for what is rationally and self-evidently morally right? How depressing. Maybe that is why the most religious countries and states remain the poorest, most violent and most bigoted, because God isn't making them feel guilty enough."
655846,A significant demographic of Trump's voters was no doubt a push back against the left without any particular affiliation with the right.

A single income doctor family earning $300k will pay approximately 13 times more tax than a double income family earning $75k total ( median household income in Canada).  Doctor's family will receive less benefit ( no child support benefit, no free college tuition, no 50% subsidized cpp like a regular employee, no vacation pay, no pension) than the median income family yet will be forced to 13 times more.   ASK THE PEOPLE IF THEY WANT TO FORCE THEIR FAMILY DOCTOR TO PAY 13 TIMES AN AVERAGE INCOME EARNING FAMILY'S TAX.   Almost anyone with any sense will say that that is not fair.  This is not a fair system."
